# SQL-Project-Pan-Card-Validation
Developed a PAN card validation project using SQL and regex to verify correct format as per guidelines of the Income Tax Department. Implemented pattern matching to ensure five uppercase letters, four digits, and one uppercase letter structure. Improved data accuracy, prevented invalid entries, and enhanced database quality control.
